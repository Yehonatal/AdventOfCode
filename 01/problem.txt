1: Trebuchet?! ---
 - combining the first digit and the last digit (in that order) to form a single two-digit number.
    For example:
        1abc2
        pqr3stu8vwx
        a1b2c3d4e5f
        treb7uchet      # If there is only 1 digit then you repeat it cause its the first and last digit by it self
    In this example, the calibration values of these four lines are 12, 38, 15, and 77. Adding these together produces 142.

    TasK: Consider your entire calibration document. What is the sum of all of the calibration values?
