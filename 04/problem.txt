4: Scratchcards (https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/4) ---
PART ONE    
    - each card has two lists of numbers separated by a vertical bar (|): a list of winning numbers and then a list of numbers you have. you have to figure out which of the numbers you have appear in the list of winning numbers. The first match makes the card worth one point and each match after the first doubles the point value of that card.

    For example:
        Card 1: 41 48 83 86 17 | 83 86  6 31 17  9 48 53
        Card 2: 13 32 20 16 61 | 61 30 68 82 17 32 24 19
        Card 3:  1 21 53 59 44 | 69 82 63 72 16 21 14  1
        Card 4: 41 92 73 84 69 | 59 84 76 51 58  5 54 83
        Card 5: 87 83 26 28 32 | 88 30 70 12 93 22 82 36
        Card 6: 31 18 13 56 72 | 74 77 10 23 35 67 36 11
    In the above example, card 1 has five winning numbers (41, 48, 83, 86, and 17) and eight numbers you have (83, 86, 6, 31, 17, 9, 48, and 53). Of the numbers you have, four of them (48, 83, 17, and 86) are winning numbers! That means card 1 is worth 8 points (1 for the first match, then doubled three times for each of the three matches after the first).

        Card 2 has two winning numbers (32 and 61), so it is worth 2 points.
        Card 3 has two winning numbers (1 and 21), so it is worth 2 points.
        Card 4 has one winning number (84), so it is worth 1 point.
        Card 5 has no winning numbers, so it is worth no points.
        Card 6 has no winning numbers, so it is worth no points.

    Task: How many points are they worth in total?

    WHAT I UNDERSTAND:
        -> find the intersect between the winning numbers and my numbers after parsing the two lists out of ever line and get a point variable running which ill add to the sum after each line is complete 

    
    POSSIBLE SOLUTION:
        - parse out the two lists for the wining numbers and the lottery numbers then find there intersect which will be the winning numbers 

PART TWO 
    - you win copies of the scratchcards below the winning card equal to the number of matches. So, if card 10 were to have 5 matching numbers, you would win one copy each of cards 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15.

    This time, the above example goes differently:
        Card 1: 41 48 83 86 17 | 83 86  6 31 17  9 48 53
        Card 2: 13 32 20 16 61 | 61 30 68 82 17 32 24 19
        Card 3:  1 21 53 59 44 | 69 82 63 72 16 21 14  1
        Card 4: 41 92 73 84 69 | 59 84 76 51 58  5 54 83
        Card 5: 87 83 26 28 32 | 88 30 70 12 93 22 82 36
        Card 6: 31 18 13 56 72 | 74 77 10 23 35 67 36 11
            Card 1 has four matching numbers, so you win one copy each of the next four cards: cards 2, 3, 4, and 5.
            Your original card 2 has two matching numbers, so you win one copy each of cards 3 and 4.
            Your copy of card 2 also wins one copy each of cards 3 and 4.
            Your four instances of card 3 (one original and three copies) have two matching numbers, so you win four copies each of cards 4 and 5.
            Your eight instances of card 4 (one original and seven copies) have one matching number, so you win eight copies of card 5.
            Your fourteen instances of card 5 (one original and thirteen copies) have no matching numbers and win no more cards.
            Your one instance of card 6 (one original) has no matching numbers and wins no more cards.
            Once all of the originals and copies have been processed, you end up with 1 instance of card 1, 2 instances of card 2, 4 instances of card 3, 8 instances of card 4, 14 instances of card 5, and 1 instance of card 6. In total, this example pile of scratchcards causes you to ultimately have 30 scratchcards!

    Task: how many total scratchcards do you end up with?


    WHAT I UNDERSTAND:
        -> I win a copy for each match i get on the current scratchcard on the next cards ig :) so ill need to keep track of all the copies and return there sum? i think 
    
    POSSIBLE SOLUTION:
        - for each intersect meaning winning number for example on card 1 (4) the next 4 cards will get a copies so ill need to iterate the intersects on card 1 then update the next affected cards ( meaning update them with there copies )

        so best way i can implement it is 

        1 ( first card will have 4 copies for the next 4 cards )

        2   2 (this also has 2 copies for the next 2 cards )

        3   (3)   (3   3) (this also has 2 copies for the next 2 cards)

        4   (4)   (4   4)   (4   4   4   4) ( this has 1 copy for the next card )

        5   (5)   (5    5   5   5)  (4   4   4   4   4   4   4   4)

        6 ( only card)

        The sum is 30 cards 

        + Ill need to keep track of how many copies the current cards has so i can add them to the next card if that card has a winning number of its own
